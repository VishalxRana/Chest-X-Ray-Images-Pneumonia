# Chest X-ray Pneumonia Predicion
This project was made with Transfer Learning method, using VGG 16 model. The project's dataset was found on (kaggle)[https://www.kaggle.com/paultimothymooney/chest-xray-pneumonia]. The data was provided into 3 folders, viz. train, test and val. 

The project was to classify whether the patient has pneumonia or not. The data folders were subdivided into two folders of NORMAL & PNEUMONIA. 

## Visualizing the data 
Here is the image of a NORMAL patient's chest X-ray and a PNEUMONIA patient's chest X-ray.

## Visualizing augmented images
We have augmented the images from the original data, like flipping them, shearing them, rotating them upto a certain degree, etc. in order to increase the data slightly. This will add modified images to the dataset as well.
